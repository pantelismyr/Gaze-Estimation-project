# Gaze Estimation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

This project work was based on the paper of Krafka et. al (see below) "#Eye tracking for everyone". Additional experiments were conducted in order to better understand the importance of each individual input frame and their influence on decreasing the error of the model. Moreover, different activation function and optimizers were used as well as a change in the model's architecture. For a detailed overview go through the project report.
